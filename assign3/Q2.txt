A room contains 6 computers. Each computer is directly connected to 0 or more
of the other computers in the room. Show that there are at least two computers in the room
that are directly connected to the same number of other computers.
Hint: You might first try the problem assuming each computer is directly connected to 1 or
more of the other computers.


Pigeon Hole Principle with Maps:
Proof by Induction:
Let there be a graph with only 2 nodes has either 0 or 1 edges, and both of the nodes will have the same degree (number of connections)

If we assume this holds for n nodes and that there are two or more of these nodes with the same degree.
If we take this existing graph with n nodes and at most n-1 different degrees (and any possible lower value excluding one number from 0->n-1 for the pair to occur).
If we add one more node and continually add it's edges while examining it; if we leave it at degree 0, the pair that was existing will continue to exist and thus at least one pair remainds.
If when we add this edge we add it to one with a unique degree, then an existing pair of verticies with equal degrees will remain intact as we will have created a new pairing.
If ween we add the edge we connect it to a member of a pair with the same degree then if there is another pair then the pair will remain.
If however, that was the only pair, then the list of degrees of the previous graph had one of two elements missing: the maximum number (n+1) or some other number.
    If it was d+1 that was missing, we now have a pair with degree 1.
    If it was some other degree then we will now have a pair with degree n-1.
    
No matter which situation we add the node's edges in, we will always retain at least one pairing of nodes with the same degree. 
Thus with 6 computers in the room and some number of connections >= 0 we will always have at least a pair of computers with the same number of connections
