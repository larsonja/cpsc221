If n mod 3 = 0 //div by 3
If n mod 3 = 1 
If n mod 3 = 2

3 cases, if n mod 3 = 0,1,2
if n mod 3 != 0 then alice can pick 1 or 2 respectively and be left with 0 remaining pieces for bob to pick up
if n mod 3 = 0 however, then alice cannot pickup all 3 pieces, and is required to leave 1 or 2 pieces, meaning bob can take the remaining

base case n = 1, alice takes 1 and wins the game.
base case n = 2, alice takes 2 and wins the game.
base case n = 3, If alice takes 1, bob takes 2; If alice takes 2, bob takes 1

alice must always make the number of remaining links not divisible by 3 


for a case where we have (3n) pieces, alice must keep the number of pieces at the end of each round as anything but 3(n-1) otherwise she conceeds the chance to win to bob.
If there are (3n + 1) or 3(n + 2) pieces then alice must follow the same strategy of trying to reduce the number of pieces to either be 3(n - k + 1) or +2 for k rounds,
or have it reduce to only having only 1 or 2 pieces left on the last round. Either way all three cases will resolve to one of the different base cases from above and she must play accordingly.
